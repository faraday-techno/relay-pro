# FAQ's
> Frequently asked questions

_1. Why extension is not published in Google Web Store?_

Chrome web store is a great place for the most of the extensions, but this particular extension needs frequent updates to retrofit changes in Amazon Relay website. Google review time for new updates are usually two to three weeks, meaning if there are a breaking changes to the website, extension might not work for weeks. While in Gumroad, updates can be delivered instantly. 

_2. Does extension book every order that appears on the board and guarantees it?_

Extension does not guarantee that every order it encounters will be booked since it depends on the factors such as 'Order could have been modified', 'Order has already been booked', 'Fails to fetch data' etc. which is outside of extensions control. 

_3. Sometimes I am getting an error when trying to book an order. Why is that?_

Extension is not responsible for reliability of relay.amazon.com. System failures may happen due to many reasons which is outside of extensions control.

_4. When higher refresh rate was set for Auto Book, 'no search results' is not showing up and loader is hang on the screen. Is it working?_

After the recent updates to relay.amazon.com, 'Similar matches' call is being made along with call exact match orders. This is causing loader to hang little longer on the screen. Although, it may feel like it is refreshing, calls are going through and extension is checking for updates. 

_5. Can you increase refresh rate to 10 refresh rates per second?_

There is a technical limitation on how many updates you can make each second depending on data. Any time board refreshes, it makes a call to Amazon Servers over the internet protocol called HTTP. Server needs at least 50/80 milliseconds to process the request (This is considered fast). Adding request/response travel time to that and amount of data returning, each refresh at least needs 160/180 milliseconds. We want it faster too, unfortunately we don't have control over it. 

_6. Does extension work in other browsers other than Chrome?_

Currently, extension only works in Chrome.

_7. Does subscribers get new product updates for free?_ 

Yes. We will notify when new update is available through our channels of communication.

_8. How often updates are published?_

New features will be added on monthly basis, whereas bug fixes will be addressed immediately.

_9. Can I cancel after my subscription?_

Yes, you can cancel any time.
